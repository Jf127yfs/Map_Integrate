## 🎯 Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Choose a Feature (RIGHT NOW)

Pick ONE feature from this list:

**🟢 Low Risk (Best First Choice)**

**Option A: Enhanced Analytics Display** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- Time: 2-3 hours
- Risk: Very low
- What: Add statistics panels to Wall
- Why: Improves insights, zero risk to existing code

**Option B: Guest Profile Page**
- Time: 4-6 hours
- Risk: Very low
- What: Individual guest detail view
- Why: Completely new, isolated feature

**Option C: Export/Download Features**
- Time: 2-3 hours
- Risk: Very low
- What: Download guest data as CSV
- Why: Useful utility, read-only

**🟡 Medium Risk (After First Feature)**

**Option D: Compatibility Scoring**
- Time: 6-8 hours
- Risk: Medium
- What: Calculate match scores between guests

**Option E: Real-Time Updates**
- Time: 4-6 hours
- Risk: Medium
- What: Auto-refresh Wall when guests check in

---

### Step 2: Plan the Feature (30 minutes)

Once you choose a feature:

1. **Copy the template:**
```bash
cp FEATURE_TEMPLATE.md features/FEAT-001-your-feature-name.md
```

2. **Fill out the template:**
   - Read each section
   - Answer all questions
   - Write test cases
   - Identify risks

3. **Review your plan:**
   - Does it follow RULES.md?
   - Is risk level acceptable?
   - Are tests planned?

---

### Step 3: Set Up Development (5 minutes)

```bash
# Ensure tests pass
# (Run in Apps Script Editor)
testCheckInSystem()
testWallData()

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Ready to code!
```

---

### Step 4: Build with Test-First Approach

**ALWAYS this order:**

```
1. Write test function FIRST
   ↓
2. Run test (it should FAIL)
   ↓
3. Write feature code
   ↓
4. Run test (it should PASS)
   ↓
5. Test existing functions (should still PASS)
   ↓
6. Commit
```

**Example:**

```javascript
// STEP 1: Write test first
function testMyNewFeature() {
  const result = myNewFeature('input');
  if (!result.ok) throw new Error('Failed');
  Logger.log('✅ Test passed');
  return {passed: true};
}

// STEP 3: Write feature
function myNewFeature(input) {
  // Implementation
  return {ok: true, result: 'success'};
}

// STEP 4-5: Run all tests
testMyNewFeature()       // Should pass
testCheckInSystem()      // Should still pass
testWallData()          // Should still pass

// STEP 6: Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add: myNewFeature with tests"
```

---

## 🚫 Critical Rules (NEVER BREAK)

### Rule #1: NEVER Modify Working Code Directly
```
❌ BAD:  Edit checkInGuest() function
✅ GOOD: Create checkInGuestV2() and test separately
```

### Rule #2: ALWAYS Test Before Committing
```
Every commit must have:
✅ New test passing
✅ All existing tests passing
✅ No console errors
```

### Rule #3: NEVER Change Column Indices
```
❌ FORBIDDEN: Modify CONFIG.COL values
✅ ALLOWED:   Add new columns at END (AE, AF, AG...)
```

### Rule #4: Git Commit Before Risky Changes
```
Before any risky change:
git commit -m "CHECKPOINT: Before risky change"
```

### Rule #5: When Things Break - STOP
```
DO NOT make more changes
↓
git reset --hard HEAD~1
↓
Restore Apps Script from version history
↓
Understand what broke
↓
Fix properly
```

**Full rules:** See RULES.md

## 🆘 If Something Breaks

### STOP. DO THIS:

1. **Don't panic, don't make more changes**

2. **Check what broke:**
```
Apps Script: View → Logs
Browser: F12 → Console
```

3. **Rollback:**
```bash
# Git rollback
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Or restore in Apps Script
File → Version history → Restore previous version
```

4. **Verify system works:**
```javascript
testCheckInSystem()  // Should pass
testWallData()      // Should pass
```

5. **Debug offline, then fix properly**

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### DO:
- ✅ Read RULES.md thoroughly (10 minutes well spent)
- ✅ Fill out FEATURE_TEMPLATE.md completely
- ✅ Write tests before code
- ✅ Commit small, working changes
- ✅ Ask questions when unsure

### DON'T:
- ❌ Skip planning phase

## 📞 Decision Tree

**"Should I modify this file?"**
```
Is it in README, CHANGELOG, or docs?
├─ Yes → Safe to edit ✅
└─ No → Does it contain core logic?
    ├─ Yes → DON'T modify directly! Create new version
    └─ No → Check file safety level in DEVELOPMENT.md
```

**"Should I add this column?"**
```
Is it at the END of the sheet (after column AD)?
├─ Yes → Safe to add ✅
└─ No → DON'T! Will break column indices ❌
```

**"Should I deploy this change?"**
```
Do all tests pass?
├─ Yes → Did you test in browser?
│   ├─ Yes → Updated CHANGELOG?
│   │   ├─ Yes → Safe to deploy ✅
│   │   └─ No → Update docs first
│   └─ No → Test in browser first
└─ No → Fix tests before deploying ❌
```
